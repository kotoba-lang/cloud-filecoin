  "PieceCID v2 — the name a piece of data has to Filecoin Onchain Cloud.

  Specified by FRC-0069. A PieceCID is a CIDv1 with the **raw** codec
  (`0x55`) and the multihash `fr32-sha2-256-trunc254-padded-binary-tree`
  (`0x1011`), whose digest is not a hash of the bytes but a small structure:

      [padding varint][height 1 byte][root 32 bytes]

  so the CID carries the piece's exact size as well as its commitment. That
  is what distinguishes v2 from the old PieceCID (`fil-commitment-unsealed`,
  `0xf101`, multihash `0x1012`), which held only the root and left the size
  to be carried alongside — and lost.

  The pipeline, and why each step exists:

  1. **Zero-pad** the payload up to `127 × 2^n` source bytes. The tree has to
     be complete, and a quad is 127 bytes.
  2. **FR32 expand**: every 127 source bytes become 128, by inserting two
     zero bits every 254 bits. 254 is the number of bits of a BLS12-381 field
     element that can hold arbitrary data; the two zero bits keep each 32-byte
     leaf below the field modulus, so a leaf is always a valid `Fr`.
  3. **Merkle** over 32-byte leaves, where a parent is
     `SHA-256(left ‖ right)` **with the top two bits of the last byte
     cleared**. Same reason: a node has to be a field element too. Plain
     SHA-256 gives a different root about half the time, which is the shape
     of bug that produces a piece nobody can prove.

  `padding` is then `127 × 2^(height-2) − payload-size`: the count of zero
  bytes step 1 added. It is stored so the original size can be recovered from
  the CID alone.

  This is byte arithmetic in Clojure over vectors, so it is not fast. It is
  intended for pieces of the size a test or a manifest has, not for hashing a
  32 GiB sector — see the README."
