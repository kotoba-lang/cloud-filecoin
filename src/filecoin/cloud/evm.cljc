  "Calldata → a Filecoin message. The join between the two halves of this
  workspace's Filecoin support.

  Onchain Cloud's contracts are FEVM contracts, so `filecoin.cloud.pdp` and
  friends produce Ethereum calldata. But an FEVM contract is also an ordinary
  Filecoin *actor* with an `f410f…` address, and calling it is an ordinary
  Filecoin *message*:

      to      the contract's f410f address (not its 0x… form)
      method  filecoin.method/invoke-contract   (FRC-0042 \"InvokeEVM\")
      params  the calldata, as a CBOR **byte string**

  Three details, each of which produces a well-formed message that does the
  wrong thing:

  - **`params` is CBOR-wrapped, not raw.** `InvokeContract` takes
    `abi.CborBytes`, so the calldata is a CBOR byte string — a `0x58 <len>`
    header and then the bytes. Passing the calldata unwrapped gives the actor
    a parameter block it cannot decode, and the message reverts having
    already paid for the gas.
  - **`to` is the f410f address.** `filecoin.cloud.chain` stores contracts in
    their `0x…` form because that is what an explorer and an ABI show; a
    message field takes address bytes. `chain/eth->f4` converts.
  - **The sender decides the signature type, and the two are not
    equivalent.** An `f1` sender signs the message CID (secp256k1) and this
    library can build everything it needs. An `f410f` sender signs the
    RLP-encoded Ethereum transaction (delegated) — a different payload
    entirely, which `io-filecoin` deliberately cannot produce. So the path
    that works end-to-end here is the native one, from an `f1` account.

  What is still missing to send one: gas. `gas-limit`, `gas-fee-cap` and
  `gas-premium` have to come from `Filecoin.GasEstimateMessageGas`, and
  `nonce` from `Filecoin.MpoolGetNonce` — both are calls, and this library
  makes no calls. `filecoin.rpc` builds those request bodies."
