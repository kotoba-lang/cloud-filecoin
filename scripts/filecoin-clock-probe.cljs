;; filecoin-clock-probe.cljs — one endpoint-health-shaped probe for the
;; filecoin.cloud guest clock: fetch a REAL calibration block header over
;; read-only RPC, run the native guest (kototama executor) against the
;; chain's own claimed height, and report drift + verdict.
;;
;; This is the agent-side measurement half. The endpoint-health manifest
;; probes run plain HTTP; this one additionally runs a local native binary
;; (kexe via kototama), so it lives as its own script rather than a manifest
;; row. Output shape mirrors verify-endpoint-health's verdict vocabulary:
;;   ok | answered-badly | unanswered  (+ skipped when the amu/runtime
;;   measurement is missing on this machine)
;;
;; Read-only: no keys, no signing, no spend. RPC calls: 1 (eth_getBlockByNumber).
;;
;; Prereqs (measured on this machine 2026-09-04):
;;   /tmp/fc-runtime.edn + /tmp/fc-loader  from: amu measure-runtime
;;   /tmp/fc-cp.txt                        from: clojure -Spath -M:native-run in amu
;;   host/live_probe.clj also on the classpath (/tmp/fc_live_probe.clj)
